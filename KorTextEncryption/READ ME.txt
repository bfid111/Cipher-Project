Explanation

1. Converts a given English text into Korean ASCII correspondingly.
	ex) Letter 'H' will be converted to an ASCII value of a
	Korean letter that is on the same key of a Korean keyboard, which is "คว"
	Different languages have different ASCII values despite being
	on a same key on a keyboard. 
2. With a cipher, encrypts the converted text.

This way,  it is theoretically impossible for someone to decrypt
the encrypt the text unless the person knows that this uses such
encryption method. 

Example :
INPUT = "hello"
Converted Text = 1263112599126431264312624
Then, the converted text will be encrypted using a cipher.
